    public static final String STORY_1 = "I lost my children through a relationship breakup\n" +
            "That was difficult because it dragged on for such a long time that it became like part of my life that every day at night, I was alone. I would think about my kids and I would always be sad\n" +
            "While I was driving and at work, I would just cry all the time. I would drink until I fell asleep. I just tried to get out of reality and not be part of the system that I felt was causing me so much pain.There was light at the end of the tunnel and every day I had support from my sister\n" +
            "She was there for me and without saying too much, she would always makes sure that she knew where I was. Now I’m able to listen to you.";

    public static final String STORY_2 = "I was just sad all the time. Even in my room by myself, I was still sad\n" +
            "I would cry quite a lot. I got into self-harm. Depression was actually quite confusing because I didn’t know what was going on, and didn’t have a way to ask anyone, or communicate it.\n" +
            "A friend from church helped me get support. I now get disability funded support from our government to help with all my personal care and cooking. It also helps when I can predict what’s going to happen. So, having all those routines and writing down exactly what I’m doing and when stuff is due.";

    public static final String STORY_3 = "9.5/10 times, I struggle with talking to people, even my own friends and family. Even my own parents sometimes. As a result my life is a life of constant pain and loneliness, even when I am with my friends and family. I can't hold conversations because my mind is too blank to start one or add anything other than \"yeah, uh-huh\" to a preexisting conversation. Talking to people one on one is a constant nightmare because I am incapable of holding up my part of the conversation or starting one. As a result, I always feel very uncomfortable around one on one conversations and always fear being caught in one.";

    public static final String STORY_4 = "I feel so passive and weak. I feel like I just want to get under a blanket, cry, and go to sleep. I am terrified that this is how I am going to be for the rest of my life. Because, I'm being honest here, this is not even close to a life worth living.";

    public static final String STORY_5 = "I got unwell and I didn’t get the support I probably needed\n" +
            "You know, it doesn’t make them bad people, they’re just probably not the right person, at this time. Endometriosis played a huge role within my depression and anxiety because it’s something I can’t control.";

    public static final String STORY_6 = "I feel busy even though I’m not busy. Anxiety for me is like, everything’s fast but it’s not fast. That something’s about to go wrong but I don’t know what it is.";

    public static final String STORY_7 = "Medication formed one piece of the pie which was my recovery journey\n" +
            "In the past, I’d expected medication to make me happy. Whereas this time round, I expected it to be part of my support kit. It helped me to be able to think clearer, to understand what was going on and to do the work with my counsellor.";

    public static final String STORY_8 = "I’ve got some connection with others and it gives me a purpose\n" +
            "Connection with others is really important, with my family, with my son and with my partner and with my friends. Work also provides me with a sense of belonging. I feel like I’ve found my people after long lone walk.";

    public static final String STORY_9 = "To keep well now, I do a bit of a mixture. Acupuncture, joga and walks are incredible for my pain and stress levels. Exercise is big -taking our puppy for walks and seeing her happy, makes me happy. My husband plays a huge role in my journey to being well.";

    public static final String STORY_10 = "I felt quite sad, very lonely and often quite tearful\n" +
            "So I started rebelling from around that age. I kind of lost control. It felt like I was being subjected to life rather than living life; I was being subjected to just having to be here. I didn’t really talk to anybody about it for a long time.";

    public static final String STORY_11 = "I'm a 14-year-old girl with two younger brothers. They fight all the time, which I understand is normal. The problem is, my dad favors my youngest brother. If there's a conflict between my brothers, he always punishes the oldest whether he deserves it or not. I have come to realize this is because of my dad's own bad relationship with his older brother and that this is his way of getting revenge.\n" +
            "It's taking a toll on my brother emotionally because he already struggles with school and sports. I'm afraid he will become depressed. My mom will never speak up about it, and when I do, despite my good relationship with my dad, he punishes me. Sometimes I'm afraid he'll become violent.";

    public static final String STORY_12 = "I used to have a girls group who I used to hang with all the time. Now they all have boyfriends and I am the only single. My friends don't meet anymore and I'm feeling left out.";

    public static final String STORY_13 = "I'm a young woman of 16 years and I'm in the second year of high school. Next year will be my last, and then I will have the pressure of relatives and friends wondering what I will do with my life.";

    public static final String STORY_14 = "I'm 23 and my problem is, when I look in the mirror, all I can see is ugliness.";

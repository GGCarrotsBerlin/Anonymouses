Dealing with emotional crisis can be isolating, especially if you donâ€™t have anyone close to you that can identify with your struggles. 
Anonymouse is there to connect people with similar struggles no matter where they are. This tool gives you access to a community of people 
who are willing to share their stories. Anonymouse is an app that works to boosts your well-being by introducing you to a community 
of like-minded people, and giving you a place to journal your thoughts and feelings. App has considerable value for both sides 
- those willing to share their stories and those who want to be heard. The app also features matching in order to be connected to 
similar stories of people without social media filter and judgement.
